# ping-pong-game

## Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to develop a simple Ping-Pong game prototype that includes automatic ball movement, two rackets controlled by the keyboard, and a losing condition when a player misses the ball.

---

## Classes
- ***GameSprite***: _A basic class to load images, set size and position, and draw the object._
- ***Player***: _Inherits from GameSprite, and adds movement with keyboard keys (W/S for left racket, UP/DOWN for right racket)._

---

## Main Game Objects
- ***racket1*** and ***racket2***: _The two rackets for each player._
- ***ball***: _The ball that moves and decides who loses the game._

---

## Game Logic
- The ball moves by itself.
- It bounces when it hits the rackets or the top/bottom walls.
- If the ball goes past the left edge, Player 1 loses.  
  If it goes past the right edge, Player 2 loses.

## Distinctive Features of the Project
- Two-player control using keyboard keys.  
- Easy win/lose condition.

## Project Prospects
***This game has potential for further development, including:***
1. Adding a scoring system to track each playerâ€™s points.
2. Increasing the difficulty over time by speeding up the ball.
3. Implementing sound effects and background music.
